## 📖 Overview

**QR Attendance System** is a robust, clean, and efficient desktop application designed to streamline the attendance tracking process for lectures and sessions. 

Built with **.NET 8 (WPF)**, it acts as a local server that generates unique dynamic sessions. Students can check in by scanning a QR code displayed on the instructor's screen, which directs them to a locally hosted captive portal—**no external internet required**. The system ensures security through device fingerprinting and IP validation to prevent proxy attendance.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 Local HTTP Server**: Runs a lightweight web server directly from the application (no IIS needed).
- **🔒 Anti-Proxy Security**: 
  - Validates Local IP to ensure physical presence.
  - Device Fingerprinting to prevent multiple check-ins from the same device.
  - Camera blocking to ensure students stay on the page until lecture ends.
- **📱 Student Web Portal**:
  - Responsive, modern mobile-first interface.
  - Clean "White & Green" aesthetic.
  - Real-time session timer and status.
- **🎛️ Session Management**:
  - Adjustable Login and Lecture durations.
  - Ability to **Extend** session time on the fly.
  - Real-time monitoring of online visitors and checked-in students.
- **📊 Reporting**: Export attendance lists to CSV instantly.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Core**: C# .NET 8.0
- **Framework**: Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
- **Networking**: `System.Net.HttpListener` for handling local web requests.
- **Frontend (Student Portal)**: HTML5, CSS3 (Custom modern UI with Inter font).
